Introduction </br>
  • Inspiration </br>
      We wanted to build an interactive and attractive website that educates people on 5G and fiber technology, allows them to see the coverage in their area, and follow     AT&T's updates on social media platforms Facebook and Instagram. With a user-friendly </br> </br>
  • What it does </br>
    The platform contains </br> </br>
  • How it was built </br>
    This website was built using git, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We used HTML and JavaScript for the content and functionalities of the page and CSS to design it and         make it AT&T branded. We used VSCode as our IDE. </br> </br>
  • Challenges you ran into </br>
    The majority of our team has never participated in a hackathon before, so this is our first time working on a team in a time constraint to build a project. It was       difficult to balance this project with our schoolwork, especially heading into finals seasons. We had to learn to apply multiple technologies such as HTML, CSS, and     JavaScript. </br> </br>
  • Accomplishments you're proud of </br> 
    We are proud of our effective communication and collaboration through email and github as well as the creativity and innovative product that we developed in such a       short period of time. We are also proud of our ability to prioritize this project along with our individual routines and being able to work together across different     time zones. </br> </br>
  • What you learned </br>
    We learned how to communicate effectively and delegate tasks that people were willing and able to do. We considered everyone's suggestions and developed different       parts of the website to showcase our individual creativity and blended perspectives to create an engaging and unique experience for customers. 
  • Next steps if the project were to continue </br> </br>
    The next steps of our project would be to include coverage area map and more details and information on what AT&T offers. Additionally, we want to include more           resources to improve the visualization of the website. We want to add a chatbot or a feedback form for users to ask questions and provide feedbacks so AT&T can cater     the experience to them, further emphasizing their customer-centric ideals. We also want to add a comparison chart between 4G and 5G experience to help users gain an     even better understanding of how their network would improve by using AT&T's 5G service.
