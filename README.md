Introduction </br>
  • Inspiration </br>
     We wanted to build an interactive website that educates people on 5G and fiber technology and keep them updated on AT&T's technologies by following them on           social media platforms Facebook and Instagram. With a user-friendly interface, we are hoping that more people will click on the website and read about AT&T's           services as well as follow their social media. </br> </br>
  • What it does </br>
    The website is promoting AT&T's 5G and Fiber network by providing users a friendly and attractive website to learn more about AT&T's services and see the coverage     in their area. The platform contains a navigation bar at the top of the screen that takes users to AT&T's home, Why AT&T, support, and contact page. Below that,       there is a coverage map as well as some basic information about 5G and Fiber technologies. There are 2 social media links beneath that for users to follow and stay     updated. The website is also mobile-friendly so users can view all of this information on their phones.</br> </br>
  • How it was built </br>
    This website was built using git, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We used HTML and JavaScript for the content and functionalities of the page and CSS to design it and       make it AT&T branded. We used VSCode as our IDE. </br> </br>
  • Challenges you ran into </br>
    The majority of our team has never participated in a hackathon before, so this is our first time working on a team in a time constraint to build a project. It was     difficult to balance this project with our schoolwork, especially heading into finals seasons. We had to learn to apply multiple technologies such as HTML, CSS,       and JavaScript. </br> </br>
  • Accomplishments you're proud of </br> 
    We are proud of our effective communication and collaboration through email and github as well as the creativity and innovative product that we developed in such a     short period of time. We are also proud of our ability to prioritize this project along with our individual routines and being able to work together across             different time zones. </br> </br>
  • What you learned </br>
    We learned how to communicate effectively and delegate tasks that people were willing and able to do. We considered everyone's suggestions and developed different     parts of the website to showcase our individual creativity and blended perspectives to create an engaging and unique experience for customers. </br> </br>
  • Next steps if the project were to continue </br>
    The next steps of our project would be to include coverage area map and more details and information on what AT&T offers. Additionally, we want to include more         resources to improve the visualization of the website. We want to add a chatbot or a feedback form for users to ask questions and provide feedbacks so AT&T can         cater the experience to them, further emphasizing their customer-centric ideals. We also want to add a comparison chart between 4G and 5G experience to help users     gain an even better understanding of how their network would improve by using AT&T's 5G service. </br> </br>

What are the Key Frameworks that you are using </br>
    Our project is using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. If we require to use a framework for the frontend, we might use Boostrap to improve the styling. </br>
