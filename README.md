Introduction </br>
  • Inspiration </br>
     We aimed to create an interactive website that educates people on 5G and fiber technology and keep them updated on AT&T's technologies by following them on social media platforms Facebook and Instagram. With a user-friendly interface, we hope that more people will click on the website and read about AT&T's services, and follow their social media handles. </br> </br>
  • What it does </br>
    The website promotes AT&T's 5G and Fiber network by providing users a friendly and attractive website to learn more about AT&T's services and see the coverage in their area. The platform includes a navigation bar at the top of the screen that directs the users to AT&T's home, Why AT&T, support, and contact page. 
    Below that, there is a coverage map as well as basic information about 5G and Fiber technologies. There are two social media links beneath that for users to follow and stay     updated. The website is also mobile-friendly, allowing users to view all of this information on their phones.</br> </br>
  • How it was built </br>
    This website was built using Git, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML and JavaScript were used for the content and functionalities of the page, and CSS was used to design it and make it AT&T branded. We used VSCode as our IDE. </br> </br>
  • Challenges you ran into </br>
    As most of our team had not participated in a hackathon before, this is our first time working together in a time-constrained environment to build a project.Balancing this project with our schoolwork was challenging, especially during finals season. Additionally, we had to learn how to apply multiple technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. </br> </br>
  • Accomplishments you're proud of </br> 
    We are proud of our effective communication and collaboration through email and Github, as well as the creativity and innovation that we developed in such a short period. We are also proud of our ability to prioritize projects along with our individual routines and work together across different time zones. </br> </br>
  • What you learned </br>
    We learned how to communicate effectively and delegate tasks that people were willing and able to do. We considered everyone's suggestions and developed different parts of the website to showcase our individual creativity and blended perspectives to create an engaging and unique experience for customers. </br> </br>
  • Next steps if the project were to continue </br>
    The next steps of our project would be to include coverage area map and more details and information on what AT&T offers. We also plan to include more resources to improve the visualization of the website. Adding a chatbot or a feedback form for users to ask questions and provide feedbacks willfurther emphasize AT&T customer-centric ideals. We also want to add a comparison chart between 4G and 5G experience to help users understand how their network would improve by using AT&T's 5G service. </br> </br>

    We are planning to create an API to connect to a database where we can get the 5G coverage in US in real time using NodeJS framework. </br>
